Jointly: Signal Synchronizer
============================

The Syncing Process
-------------------

To sync two sources with each other, they need a simultaneously recorded
signal with a characteristic signature at two timepoints in common. This
could be the magnitude of the accelerometer for example, if multiple
devices are shaken together.

Selecting common segments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The script can detect prominent shakes automatically with the
``ShakeExtractor``. This is done by detecting the peaks above a certain
``threshold``. They are then merged to sequences, if two peaks are not
farther apart than a specified ``distance`` in milliseconds. Sequences
with less than ``min_length`` peaks are filtered out. Sequences, that do
not start or end in a ``window`` of seconds from start and end of the
signal respectivley, are filtered in a second step. From these filtered
sequences the sequence with the highest weight (mean + median of
sequence) is selected for the corresponding segment.

Calculation of the timeshift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compensate the differences in the system time of different sources,
the timeshift to synchronize the selected segments with each other is
calculated. For the automatic computation of the timeshift between two
signals the cross-correlation for each segment with the reference signal
is calculated. The signals are shifted so that the correlation between
the selected segments is maximized.

Adjusting the frequency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to clock drift, which denotes the issue that a clock is not running
at the exact same frequency as a specified reference clock, signals that
can be in sync at one timepoint desynchronize gradually over time. To
compensate this effect a stretching factor is calculated, which brings
the difference between the timeshifts for the synchronization based on
the first and second segment respectively to zero. After stretching the
signal, the timeshift to align the signals has to be calculated again.

Example
-------

Syncing data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data has to be provided in pandas ``DataFrame`` with a
``DateTimeIndex``.

.. code:: python

    import jointly

    sources = {
        'Faros': {
            'data': faros.data,
            'ref_column': 'acc_mag',
        },
        'Empatica': {
            'data': empatica.data,
            'ref_column': 'acc_mag',
        },
        'Everion': {
            'data': everion.data,
            'ref_column': 'acc_mag',
        }
    }
    ref_source_name = 'Empatica'

    extractor = jointly.ShakeExtractor()
    synchronizer = jointly.Synchronizer(sources, ref_source_name, extractor)
    synced_data = synchronizer.get_synced_data()

Saving data
~~~~~~~~~~~

To define the tables, which should be saved, create a dictionary. Every
key at root level defines the name of the corresponding file. The
dictionary at the second level defines a list of columns, which should
be saved in this file, for each source. The ``save_data()`` method will
also automatically save all data from all sources in a file named
``TOTAL.csv``. This can be deactivated by adding the argument
``save_total_table = False``.

.. code:: python

    tables = {
        'ACC': {
            'Faros': ['Accelerometer_X', 'Accelerometer_Y', 'Accelerometer_Z'],
            'Empatica': ['acc_x', 'acc_y', 'acc_z'],
            'Everion': ['accx_data', 'accy_data', 'accz_data'],
        },
        'PPG': {
            'Empatica': ['bvp'],
            'Everion': ['blood_pulse_wave', 'led2_data', 'led3_data'],
        },
        'EDA': {
            'Empatica': ['eda'],
            'Everion': ['gsr_electrode'],
        },
        'ECG': {
            'Faros': ['ECG'],
        },
        'TEMP': {
            'Empatica': ['temp'],
            'Everion': ['temperature_object'],
        },
        'HR': {
            'Empatica': ['hr'],
            'Everion': ['heart_rate', 'heart_rate_quality'],
        },
        'IBI': {
            'Faros': ['HRV'],
            'Empatica': ['ibi'],
            'Everion': ['inter_pulse_interval', 'inter_pulse_interval_deviation'],
        }
    }

    synchronizer.save_data(sync_dir_path, tables=tables)

Logging
-------

To activate logging simply add the following lines to your code:

.. code:: python

    from jointly.log import logger
    logger.setLevel(10)

This will give you insight into the shake detection, calculation of the
timeshifts and stretching factor, and output plots of the segements.
